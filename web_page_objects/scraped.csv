10. How long will I be treated?
There are two different treatment timelines at Mindful Care, Urgent Care and Continued Care. All new patients are entered into our 12-week urgent care plan, which consists of five appointments over that period. During this time the goal will be to get your symptoms stabilized and develop the best treatment plan for your needs.
After those 12 weeks, you will either be transitioned to our Continue Care plan or to a higher level of care more suitable for your needs. Continued Care consists of regularly scheduled appointments that will continue as long as your provider determines it is best for you and your treatment.
